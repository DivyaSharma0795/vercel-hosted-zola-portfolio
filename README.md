# IDS721 Mini Project 01 - Static Website using Zola

[Project Website](https://ids721-miniproject01-divyasharma0795-a094ba4b748189a3597541e8c4.gitlab.io/)

## Description
Creating a static website using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) - the theme used for this project is [hephaestus](https://www.getzola.org/themes/hephaestus/). The website serves as my personal profile, showcasing basic information, education, work experience, skills, and projects.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.
